There was a topic I felt very passionate about when I was in my freshman year of highschool, the wage gap. My eyes would light up in excitement every time this issue came around for discussion. "Oh, the wage gap?" I would ask snarkily as I recited a YouTube video I'd watched earlier word for word. "Actually, when you account for all factors, men and women make about the same amount of money, so you're wrong". Not exactly a great conversation starter for anyone interested in making friends, yet something about having done some amount of research on a topic and feeling like I understood it better than others made it feel so good at the time.

That feeling of constantly wanting to be right and ridiculing those whom I thought were wrong, went on to drag me down a pretty dark rabbit-hole in my early years of highschool. Where my curiousity and search for truth turned into prejudice and hatred behind my back. I went from being a kid who just wanted to play games all day to slowly becoming someone who spent his free time going out of his way to look for content made him angry at social progress. I quickly found myself repeating hateful rhetoric like that it's ok to use slurs because policing speech is bad, that women are inferior to men in intellect, and other classic talking points many of us have had the misfortune of coming across in the past.

If you ever spoke me after highschool, however, you'd know the person I'm describing here is not the kind of person I am today. So I want to talk about what got me into this mess, why I believed what I did at the time, what helped me get out of it, and how you might be able to help a friend in a similar situation.

# Atheism

Life for me at 13 was honestly pretty cool. I made minimum passing effort in school, played video games all day _every_ day and basically spent my entire life online --much like how I do now-- but without doing anything productive.

Also, like every other teenager in the world, I struggled with issues of identity. Growing up with parents who weren't religious, I was particularly interested in coming up with my own answer for the religion question. I spent a lot of time thinking about life and experienced different kinds of existential dread to finally come to the conclusion that I don't believe God exists.

I didn't get there on my own though, I'd always been really into YouTube, and I started getting recommended interesting channels that make content about atheism. I ran into videos created by public figures like <T>Richard Dawkins</T> and <T>Christopher Hitchens</T> who made arguments I thought were genius at the time. I also started following other independent creators like <T>DarkMatter2525</T> whos videos I actually still enjoy to this day.

I was really starting to relate to the humor and presentation style of these videos, and eventually started getting into the side of YouTube that's now known by some as the <T>Skeptosphere</T>. Channels with creators who claim to be skeptical of everything they're told and push viewers to always question the truths.

### Some of these channels & people were

After hearing these people's arguments against timeless theist classics like [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) and the [Watchmaker Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy), I started to look up and memorize logical fallacies like a greasy debatelord, but unironically.

# Gamergate

Unfortunately, something happened to these channels around 2013. Before that point, almost all these channels focused exclusively on atheism, but they had a sharp change in tone right before the rise of <Gamergate />. All of a sudden, the people whose views I looked up to, shifted their talking points from "fuck religion" to "fuck feminism". People like [Anita Sarkeesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian) who challenged the status quo of gaming instantly became the scapegoat of angry gamer dudes --and non-gamers sympathetic to the cause-- who didn't want women meddling in their business. It became a lot more lucrative to sell outrage than skepticism, and people around the world --especially with the rise of Trump and friends-- were ready to eat it all up.

Being a white dude who spent most of his time playing games, this had the same predictable effect on me too. Thankfully I never went as far as bullying anyone (as far as I remember, at least), but the issue definitely became an important topic for me. Crazy women were after the only thing we had left as men, and they wanted to take it away from us.

Or so I thought.

# Reasoning with misogynists

Right around the time when this was all happening, I was dating a girl in my class, let's call her <Ex />.

> Unless... you want to call her <ExShuffle>something else?</ExShuffle>

<!-- For some reason I have to use a zws when putting a component in the beginning of a line, otherwise everything breaks... -->

&#8203;<Ex /> was really into Tumblr, and inevitably ended up getting swept up in the infamous social justice side of the site as well. Unsurprisingly, this caused a lot of problems and countless arguments in our relationship. I'm not sure why she didn't dump my insufferable ass earlier because we spent more and more time fighting as we both got radicalized in opposite directions.

Of course, seeing that someone close to me was "slipping away" to the "other side" definitely made it a bigger issue for me personally, but there was something about <Ex /> that made it very difficult to talk the problem out and fueled my anger even further.

Before I elaborate, there is something I have to make clear about my stance on this issue. If you're someone who directly suffers from the ideologies of morons, you have no obligation to interact with the people who believe them. If you're a trans person, nobody has any right to tell you to reason with someone who thinks you'd be better off dead, to be "calm" or "be the bigger person" by giving them the benefit of the doubt. If you're gay and your family is about to kick you out, you have every right in the world to yell and get mad instead of trying to reason with anyone, and nobody could tell you otherwise.

However, if you are in a position where you can have these conversations, especially if you're an LGBT ally and know people holding these beliefs who respect or look up to you, you have the opportunity to make a huge impact on someone's life.

&#8203;<Ex /> didn't understand why she believed the things she did. She wasn't ready to have a discussion about her views, and didn't memorize random talking points from iamright.com the way I did, and just yelled at me for not agreeing with her ideas. Of course, relationships aren't built on being able to defend yourself in the marketplace of ideas against your own damn boyfriend, so she can't exactly be expected to do that. Not everyone has the time of day to look up logical fallacies on the down low.

export const Friend = () => (
  <Toastable textDecoration="none" text={<T color="green.400">Christina</T>}>
    Oh, this one isn't a placeholder
  </Toastable>
)

But the more I got yelled at, the more I was able to victimize myself, the more self-righteous I felt for believing what I did.

> Feminists are just crazy women who want to yell at men for no reason, as evidenced by my girlfriend.

I kept feeding these thoughts as I sought out more outrage and learned about more progressive ideas from <Ex />. This was my routine until one day, a friend of mine, let's call her <Friend />, decided to talk to me about the stuff I believe in after I went on yet another one of my tirades.

I was excited to talk to someone else about it, but the exchange felt very different from what I was used to. She didn't try to change my mind, she didn't tell me I was wrong, she didn't yell at me or tell me to go to hell the way these conversations would often carry out for me. She just sat and listened to what I had to say, and told me her side of the same issues and how my opinions make her feel.

That made me... uncomfortable. I couldn't <T>epicly own</T> her, the way I was used to at the time. I had to actually reflect on the way my actions made other people feel. This obviously didn't change my mind overnight, of course. I kept acting the same way afterwards. But it did get me thinking, whether I realized it at the time or not.

# Role models

Hearing the non-judgmental takes of people I look up to made a big difference for me. It's a lot harder to dismiss things when someone you look up to shares the same kinds of opinions you disagree with.

And that's exactly the kind of exposure and push I needed to have my mind changed. Someone I look up to who challenges my views. At this point I've become familiar with many different kinds of people, both online and IRL I look up to, but the first major change of heart I remember having came from watching a very specific playlist made by <T>Destiny</T> (the streamer, not the game).

If you're familiar with who he is, you probably know him for his recent awful takes on trans issues, among many other problematic things he's done and said in the past. But the truth is, back in early 2010s, he was one of the first few "gamers" with a sizeable followerbase to defend progressive views. At least on YouTube when the platform was teeming with radical right-wing content, before Google made any attempt to fix how the algorithm treats extremist content or started taking any kinds of action against it.
