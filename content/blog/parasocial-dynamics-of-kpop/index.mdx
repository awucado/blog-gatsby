I'm sure you can relate to this scenario if you have a Twitter account. You're sitting on the couch while on your phone, scrolling through the replies on a Twitter thread about politics and you run into one of these.

This must be an alternate reality or something, how can this be real? How can these people be real? There have been talks of Twitter being infested with Russian bots lately, is this part of it? Korean bots, is that it?

I'm afraid not. To be able to truly unpack what's going in this weird dystopian scenario, to delve into the mind of the kpop stan. Allow me to take you back to the very beginning, and walk you through what happened in the past few decades to get here and the steps that fans take that leads them to this seemingly bizarre situation.

# You, as a social creature

We all have a primal instinct of wanting to see ourselves thrive in a social environment among others where our peers care for us and this fact alone has been a driving force for what causes us to form relationships, both romantic and platonic for as long as humans have existed. But in an age where we're more interconnected but also [lonelier than ever](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2019/05/03/millennials-and-the-loneliness-epidemic/?sh=45710cdc7676), where our disagreements are heated, friendships shallow and hostility towards one another fierce, it can be difficult to figure out what kinds of bonds we want to form and with whom. Often times we feel like despite having many acquaintances, we don't have many friendships we hold dear, or that no matter how many cool people we meet, there's still an emptiness in us that we can't seem to fill. This is especially true for those of us who are still trying to figure out our place in the world, our personalities or who we are as a human being overall. Teenagers are a prime example of a group of people this applies to, but of course, you don't have to be screaming at your parents about how nobody understands you for that to hold true.

export const Brain = () => (
  <Toastable text="making friends is hard anyways" className="text-pink-400">
    "Because nobody wants to be your friend."
    <br />- 🧠
  </Toastable>
)

export const CurrentYear = () => <span>{new Date().getFullYear()}</span>

In the past, the way of dealing with deep seated loneliness like this was arguably more realistic than what we see today. "You're upset that you don't have friends? Stop crying about it and just go outside and make friends, stupid." Simple, really. But this game has changed considerably since the invention of the internet. The amount of people you have access to interacting with expanded from a bunch of boring people in your class and neighborhood to a billion+ people seemingly overnight. They're not going to **all** be your friends of course, <Brain />. But hey, maybe now it's easier to approach people.

# Rise of public figures

Instant messengers like ICQ, MSN Messenger and Skype did a great job establishing that the human connection was indeed something we craved since the very early days of the internet. From that point on to <CurrentYear />, we've started realizing that communities and the feeling of belonging in one, plays a big part in the formation of one's identity and that it's something we crave as much as individual human interaction. Twitch and the rise of streamers were one of the first waves where this started to become apparent at a global scale. Thousands of people tuning in live to watch someone play games and even donate money for recognition for hours was something that was probably unthinkable 2-3 decades ago, yet it's simply commonplace now. Viewers not are not only interested in what a public figure like a streamer does but are also invested in being a part of a group of followers too. What once started as a quirky thing we thought was about gaming turned out to be way bigger than games and instead more about satisfying a desire of wanting to be a part of a community and feeling involved in the lives of others. As more and more people started taking interest in this field, pro gamers stopped being the most interesting streamers to watch and it was instead those who interacted with you and made you laugh like your friends did back in highschool.

export const BookMeme = () => (
  <Toastable text="parasocial relationships" className="text-emerald-400">
    Oh, it's like that part in books where they mention the title for the first
    time. Exciting.
  </Toastable>
)

For many content creators --as their professional name ended up being-- having a chance to interact with viewers is something they enjoy. Unfortunately however, they only have so much time to interact with fans. If you have 5000 people watching you, you don't really have 5000 friends, it's not quite like going to grab lunch with 5000 people... at least not for you. But for a lot of people who are invested in the lives of public figures, it may as well be. They're giving affection and playing the part of a real life friend, sending messages and even providing financial support but do not get back the side of a friendship they'd normally get in a regular friendship. Even though living life vicariously through public figures has been a thing for ages, for the first time, it became highly interactive, personal, easily accessible for consumers and a possible full time job opportunity for independent creators with the popularity of streaming and related fields. This gave rise to a huge increase in <BookMeme />, a phenomenon where people in one sided relationships with public figures feel like they're in a real relationship.

Companies were not too far behind consumers in realizing this need either, they quickly jumped on board by trying to monetize the thirst for affection we feel. It also turned out that the human aspect is not much of a deal-breaker for many people as long as it's still relatable, with companies like Riot Games releasing virtual celebrities such as Seraphine, who have social media accounts run by real humans but are virtual in every other way.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Be authentically you Seraphine!! You&#39;re a beautiful light in this world
    and make it shine at Shanghai! You got this girl 🌠 We all love you!
    It&#39;s overwhelming but remember this was your dream! Live it, breathe it.
    💕 Sing from your heart.

> Others... not so much.

The same concept started to present itself in the existing streaming industry through companies like HoloLive that create virtual youtubers or personalities by taking the idea of Seraphine and adding in real-time interaction that makes these them much more relatable to everyday folk than a simple Twitter account. This, of course, is wildly successful and is slowly taking over the world.

This is the point where kpop comes in. The process that fans go through that ends with wild fanaticism is a very deliberate one made possible by the kpop industry itself. It could perhaps be defined as a well-oiled capitalism machine that runs on surgically manufactured parasocial relationships. It's imilar to the one pre-pubescent girls used to go through during the justin bieber arc of pop music but you might notice that it's not quite the same. Perhaps it's because social media wasn't as widespread back then, but most people would agree that the online presence of kpop and consequently, its fans are not comparable to that of beliebers or really any modern day fanbase of western pop music. There's something else that's unique to this genre that gets its fanbase so riled up. I'd like to describe it as a 3 step process.

# A Normie's Transition into Kpop

For centuries there's been an unchanging formula virtually everyone with a product to sell you has been using. Whether you're trying to hook a user on the story of your game, the events of a movie or the plot of a book, an incredibly powerful tool for achieving this is getting your audience feel personally invested in your product. Games like The Last of Us, for example, do an excellent job at this and as you may imagine the Kpop industry is no stranger to it.

Much like with pop all around the world, you're made aware of the importance the korean music industry places on image, flashy music videos, and really **really** cute girls very early on in your journey into <Hallyu />. But unlike western pop, there's a lot of importance placed on interactions between idols and fans through not only IRL events like concerts and fansigns, but also through different kinds of media like reality tv such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBdQnhwO4gQ">Blackpink House</a> or LOONA TV, going on game shows and interacting directly through apps dedicated to connecting fans and artists like VLive and Weverse. Many groups also "humanize" their fanbases by giving fans a unique name such as "Army" used to refer to BTS fans. This is a crucial part of the strong draw that kpop has as it reminds fans that even though idols might seem to be gods to them in their beauty, skill and intelligence, there's a distinctly human part to them that make it much easier for fans to form bonds with members as a community. Even if that bond is strictly one sided.

# Conversion

export const Hallyu = () => (
  <Toastable text="hallyu" className="text-indigo-400">
    Literally "korean wave", the umbrella term used to describe the recent
    Korean cultural imperialism that started in the 90's which consists of
    korean pop, TV dramas, food, language and more.
  </Toastable>
)

Despite having a global reach, kpop as a genre also seems to be effective at speaking to lonely, depressed or otherwise unhappy group of people. Its undeniably upbeat melodies, relatable lyrics (if you choose to look up the translations lol) and cute boys and girls are carefully chosen to be appealing to a large audience, one that people going through a rough time seem to be a part of more often than not.

I personally know many people who've felt like they've finally found a community they belong in with kpop, and some who've found a reason to keep living in it. To me this is so important that it almost makes all the other criticisms about the industry as a whole irrelevant. Knowing that, it may be a little bit easier to understand why so many fans around the world feel so emotional when they're confronted with outsiders who brush their favorite idols/groups off or insult the community. Nobody likes to have the people they look up to insulted.

# Community

There's a bit of a paradox with how people perceive the kpop community. Looking in from the outside, theres's no doubt it's extremely toxic given the amount of people who will go to whatever lengths necessary to embarrass themselves. But if you get to actually spend time in any one of them, there's a kind of friendship you form with people over mutual interests that I personally haven't been able to find anywhere else. As amazing as the relationships formed there can be, it's also unfortunately the biggest reason for why many fans feel like they have a personal relationship with the idols they look up to.
